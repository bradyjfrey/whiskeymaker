        <p>In 2011 I was asked while at Michigan State University to assist a small existing brand with product consistency and production methodology. I created standard operating procedures for their contract manufactured gin and whiskey, and in 2012 took a position as Head Distiller. We built a $5M facility, re-launched 3 products, trained a full production staff, built and managed a portfolio of contract production clients. I departed the company in 2014 leaving it with a full staff of distillers and QA techs producing at approximately 50k cases/year. The brands are still produced and sold under Dancing Goat Spirits.</p>
