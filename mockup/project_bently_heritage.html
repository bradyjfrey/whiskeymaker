        <p>In 2014 I was engaged as a consultant to help in the design and build of a whiskey focused distillery. The facility consisted of 2 separate distilleries, one for single malt whiskey, one for bourbon, rye, gin, and vodka. It was classified under Nevada’s estate laws so included a malting facility and 2,000 acres of grain cultivation for distillery use. It is one of the country’s only LEED gold certified distilleries for sustainable practices and reuse of historic structures.</p>
        
        <p>In 2016 I accepted the role of Master Distiller and designed all products including 4 whiskies, 2 gins, a variety of liqueurs, and a vodka, all estate products. Construction began in 2015, completed in 2017, equipment install completed in 2018, and start up commenced Aug 2018.</p> 
        
        <p>In Jan 2021 I accepted the role of General Manager as we successfully ran a regional tasting room, expanded to 5 states and in 2022 began the process seeking a buyer for the operation. In 2023 we facilitated sale and transferred ownership at which time I made the decision to exit, taking a transition contract with the buyer, Foley Family Wines and Spirits. Having supported the transfer to management by a newly hired Master Distiller and fully trained staff,  I completed my work at the site in Nov 2023.</p>
