        <p>In 2014 I was asked by SFS owner Colin Kegan to assist in production standardization and scale-up. In 2 years as consultant/Head Distiller I standardized production of all products with employee training materials, and fully trained production staff to standards. I worked with Colin on scale-up plans, facility improvements, production and financial forecasting, and company valuation.</p>
